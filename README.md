# Kaggle--House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques-
advanced linear regression modeling to predict housing prices (written in R)

## Competition description was provided by Kaggle as following:

"Ask a home buyer to describe their dream **house**, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home."
